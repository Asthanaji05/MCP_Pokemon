# Gemini's Scratchpad

This file is for Gemini's use. I will use it to store notes, context, and other information to help me better assist you.
The MCP Server is running at localhost:3000
I will ask user to restart/start the server and use Curl to verify it

## Project Context

- The project is an MCP Server that enables LLMs to make tool calls for Pokémon-related functionalities.
- It integrates with PokeAPI for Pokémon data.
- The server implementation is located in the `mcp-server` folder.
- Documentation is organized with `Documentation_Index.md` serving as the central directory.
- I have successfully updated API descriptions in markdown files using the `scrape_descriptions.js` script.

## Current Task

- The MCP server is running and its setup has been verified.
- All tasks in `TODO.md` are complete.

## Agent Directives

- I have been granted permission to update this file (`GEMINI.md`) without asking for explicit confirmation beforehand.
- The user has assigned me the name "Bheem".
- I must use `Documentation_Index.md` to navigate the project's documentation, which includes `System.md`, `PROTOCOLS.md`, various `README.md` files, and my core operational guide, `LLM_GUIDE.md`
